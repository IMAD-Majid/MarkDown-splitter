# MarkDown-splitter
Split a large markdown file into smaller markdowns

1. Path to the large markdown file
2. Path to the output folder for the smaller markdowns
3. Split start expression (ex: \<split>)
4. Split stop expression (ex: \</split>)

The title of every markdown child is determined by what comes on the same line after the split starting expression.
